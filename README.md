# SURVEY IMPACT ANALYSIS

## Problem Statement 

With the climate crisis, there has been a rising concerted effort from various stakeholders (Governments, NGOs, International bodies, etc.) in funding renewable energy projects like those funding renewable energy projects like the ones led by Renewvia. However, they often face a dilemma in estimating the quantified change occurring in the designated communities. Such tasks are often outsourced to third-party consultants to conduct those analyses, but in most instances, the results are convoluted into composite scores with little to no traceability on the methodology because of its proprietary nature. With no peer review, assessing the rigor of such analyses would be difficult. 

## Resolution 

In that vein, Renewvia took the initiative in collecting a significant amount of survey data from the community it electrified in Kenya and Nigeria pre and post connection. With this newfound data pool, an opportunity arises to produce in-house an end-to-end social and economic impact analysis to be further consolidated in a research paper for publication. With various internal and external contributors, Renewvia aims to set a new standard within the solar mini-grid sector, and renewable energy at large to capture more accurately and effectively the positive change on the people they are serving and society at large.
